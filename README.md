# Prework - *Prework*

Submitted by: **Siddharthsinh Parmar**

**Prework** is an app that is just made to cover the basics of Swift Coding and Xcode IDE.
It has my name as as icon and it can change the backgroung color and the color of text by using the
given button. It has an image attached as it was a test image.

Time spent: **2.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

The List of my favorite Apps:
    
    Discord:
        The sandwhich button which Discord has is advanced compared to other apps. It is one of the
        most common feature I use in Dicord. I like how simple yet descriptive it is.
        The usage of user-defined bots in Discord is something pretty unique to it.
    
    Netflix:
        Recently, Netflix added certain buttons in the Full Screen Window for liking/disliking
        the content you are watching. Moreover, it has option for double thumbs up, superliking the 
        content. This are small and subtle features which I anticipated earlier for Netflix to
        release.
    
    Gmail:
        Labelling mails is one of the most used feature personally. 
        Swtiching between different gmail accounts. Turning on/off the inbuilt gchat option.
        
App Idea:

    I am willing to create a Travel (Tourist) focussed app. Recently, I went to Cancun, Mexico for
    Spring Break. I had to download local apps for Food and Taxi like Didi for a better stay at 
    an Airbnb. I had to download those extra apps for a brief period of time.
    I am willing to create an app which provides the user with local apps based on the category
    (Food, Commute, Banking, etc.). This app will redirect the user to that local app/website
    and they can easily fulfill their needs instead of downloading the individual apps for a brief
    stay.

## Notes

There was not as such a major challenge I faced while doing the prework. The initial 1 hour
was challenging as I was getting accustomed to Xcode.
